Are you someone who dreams of an adventure like cycling around Tanzania, hiking up Kilimanjaro, and exploring the Serengeti? Are you a woman looking for a husband? If so, please read on!

Having just completed my first long distance cycling tour across South Africa, my heart yearns to return. I want to find the right partner to go with though, and I want her to be my future wife. Given the low chance of meeting someone, I decided to put my thoughts out there in the hopes she reads this.

I developed a serious love for nature 5 years ago, when I worked my way towards long distance backpacking trips in Peru, California and France. An injury, new love for swimming and lack of motivation to return put things on pause, until I got a bicyle a year ago. I learned of people touring by bike, and loved the idea so much I started planning some trips to provide motivation. I just completed the first: crossing South Africa, and I now have my eye on the next: crossing East Africa. If that goes well, I want to just continue going. I'm bored of the regular lifestyle, and want to explore the world we're blessed with.

If you relate to these feelings, or know someone who might, I'd love to connect with you. Obviously, I'm talking about women here, as I made clear at the start of this post. I must also add that I'm Muslim, and a Muslim male is only allowed to marry a Muslim woman\*. She is allowed to convert after meeting though. I'll also add that I'm vegan, more to attract another vegan/vegetarian rather than put fort another requirement.

I don't care if the person has been married before, the colour of her skin, or any of those sort of details. What I care about is that she has the same desire to travel the world by bike. That we might raise a family that's unrooted from any one place. There are many couples who do this: [here](https://bikepacking.com/plan/bikepacking-couple/), [here](https://bikepacking.com/plog/lost-captures-film/), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJrABpbxbNQ) and [here](https://pedalpromise.com/world-bicycle-touring-couple/).

My interests in bike touring are largely off-road. I want to get away from cars and into nature. I want to get away from the major cities, and explore the lesser known areas of a country. I'd love to join these travels with hiking, swimming, horse riding and other activities. I get bored by long stretches of flat, and love the mountains. I wild camp where I can, and find formal campsites where it makes sense. I love cooking when I get to camp, and even more so on rest days. Generally, I try to travel frugally to make what I have last.
